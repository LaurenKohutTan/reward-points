## Setup

Clone the repo and install the needed deps from the `requirements.txt` file.
Then create a `config.toml` file in the project root with the same structure as the `example-config.toml`.
Finally, start the server with `python3 src`.

Now you will need to create a project on Google Cloud Platform and obtain a client ID and client secret.
These values can be put in the `config.toml` file.
